## Notes on class test 1


* Mock is the test from last year
* NOTE some of these questions (eg 4, 10) you can do, but really they
  are based on material we haven't covered yet (sorting)


## Notes on class test 3


* NOTE that qu 6 looks like a misprint.
* NOTE also that some of the questions in these tests are on material we haven't covered this year.

The feedback machine is one way we give feedback during the labs
(alternatively, just ask a TA to give you help). Please make sure to do
the lab in week 1, which will get you familiar with its use.

The feedback machine uses bash scripts, so unfortunately will likely not
work on Windows. There is a chance it will work on Mac. Ideally,
students should use the computers in the lab.

# IDE and editor: Dr Java 

There are many IDEs and text editors around. I have asked for Dr Java to
be installed. You should be able to run it by typing `drjava` on the
console. This allows you to edit, save, compile, etc. It also allows you
to interactively investigate code through the REPL (interactive Java
console).

The Dr Java homepage is <http://www.drjava.org/>

NOTE: Lab 1 was a simple lab to get used to the feedback machine and
the handin system.
# Prerequisites

What do you need to take this course? Essentially the requirements are
very little.


* You need to be comfortable using a computer; particularly you need
  to understand the concepts of **files** and **directories**.
* You also need to have a basic familiarity with the Linux **command
  line** (sometimes called the "shell" or "bash"), particularly the
  commands `cd, ls, mkdir, pwd, rm, touch, java, javac` and the syntax
  `.` and `..` for current and parent directory.
 * Information about the `java` and `javac` commands can be found
   in the additional material for week 1. A video is
   [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kgVq65NRKQ). Please also
   see the week 1 additional material (particularly the Oracle
   getting started tutorials).
 * A video discussing the basics is
   [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDINUSK7rXE) (for the
   Mac, but Linux is essentially the same)
 * Another is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x73WTEltyHU)
   (you won’t be able to use `sudo`)
 * A more detailed set of videos is by someone called Steven
   Gordon, starting
   [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGoJsAEpsM).
 * And there are many many more. Find one that works for you. There
   are also books of course, many available in the library.
   <http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596009656.do> is probably
   OK (I haven’t read it myself).
* You need to be able to use a text editor to create `.java` source
  files, and save them in different directories.
* You need to be able to compile the `.java` files on the command line
  using `javac`.
* You need to be able to run the resulting `.class` files using `java`
* You need to have a working knowledge of basic Java syntax, such as
  is taught in CO1003.


From past experience, about 50% of the students will not have these
prerequisites. If you are one of these students, you need to get these
skills as soon as possible.


<i class="material-icons">warning</i> WARNING: In the labs this week I
will do random checks on individual students (so, you need to attend
the labs and be prepared to show me you can do
the above).
# Java tutorials

## About this website

This website has 3 main pages. This is the first page. The second page
contains the weekly material. The third page contains the labs. Of course, there are further pages linked to from these pages, but essentially these are the ones you need to read fully.

<center style='font-size:2em'>[Weekly material](weeks.html) and [Labs](a_labs.html)</center>



## Announcements and module dashboard

Any timetable changes will be recorded here, and usually also emailed to all
students.

* 2018-03-20 **How to calculate your module mark!** 
    * You need to work out the following: `(10% * lab mark) + (30% *
      class test 1 mark) + (60% * class test 3 mark)`
    * For example, if you scored 3/5 for labs, 8/12 for class test 1,
      and 7/12 for class test 3, you need to calculate: `(10% * 3/5) +
      (30% * 8/12) + (60% * 7/12)`
    * In order to calculate this, you also need to know that
      percentages are just numbers. For example 10% is 10/100, 20% is
      20/100 etc
    * So the above calculation becomes: `(10/100 * 3/5) + (30/100 * 8/12) + (60/100 * 7/12)`
    * You can do this easily by hand, or use a calculator. You should
      end up with a number between 0 and 1, which is your overall
      percentage. For example 0.61 is 61/100, which is 61%.

* <i class="material-icons">warning</i> 2018-03-09 there seems to be some confusion about assessment patterns given the impact of the strike. There are threads on Piazza. To summarize:
    * Class test 2 was cancelled due to strike (and subsequent bad
      weather). **The RELATIVE WEIGHTS of class test 1 and 3 have not
      changed.** The date of class test 3 has not changed. The
      duration of class test 3 has not changed. Class test 3 will be
      mostly on the material since the last test. You will not be
      tested on material we haven't covered.
    * Following on from the last point, in general, nothing has
      changed unless I explicitly communicate this via email,
      lectures, module webpages, Piazza etc. 
    * In case of confusion, you can always ask questions on Piazza, or
      email me directly.
    * Some of the labs on strike days have been cancelled (see the lab
      page for details).
    

* The study guide is
[here](../study_guide/study_guide.pdf).
* <i class="material-icons">warning</i> 2018-02-20 strikes are likely on Thu and Fri of this week
* <i class="material-icons">warning</i> 2018-01-16 there will be no sessions on Fri 26th Jan - the convenor is in London on University business
* 2018-01-15 new webpage

 * Make sure you understand the [prerequisites](additional.html#_prerequisites) for this module.
 * Please consult the [Timetable](timetable.html) and the
   [Weekly material](weeks.html).

* **Panopto recordings** of sessions should be available
  via blackboard (module CO1005). Please let me know if this doesn't
  seem to work. Otherwise, we do not use Blackboard.


## Feedback

- Please post all queries to the module site on Piazza: 
  https://piazza.com/university_of_leicester/spring2018/co1005
  (the access code, which is case sensitive, is "co1005" )
- Teaching assistants have been advised to give even more feedback
  in labs!
- We have introduced the "Feedback machine" to give further
  automated feedback during labs.
- Piazza has been introduced to coordinate and focus student
  queries.
- If you are unsure why your code is not correct, post (anonymously
  if you like) something to Piazza and we will give feedback there
  or in the surgery. Similarly, if you are in the surgery and don't
  understand something, please ask!
- We will stress to students that the following are the main forms
  of feedback in this module: **feedback in surgeries** (lab solutions,
  worked examples, student submissions examined); class test **marked
  scripts**; class test **model answers** and **in-class explanations** with
  **question and answer** session; **in-lab feedback from TAs** and convenor
  and also automated **feedback from the Feedback machine**; feedback on
  **Piazza**
- The convenor will try very hard to encourage questions during the
  lectures, to give feedback on what students find difficult.

Essentially, we want to **ensure** that, if there is anything you
**don't understand**, you get some form of **feedback** to help you.
We believe that there are ample opportunities to get feedback. If you
feel this is not true, we want to hear about it as soon as possible.

For the sessions this week, I am happy to do whatever the students
want, but the following is my suggested schedule:

* Tuesday lecture: I will probably use this to go over trees again,
  and finish off the remaining slides on trees.
* Thursday 
    * Lecture: I will use this to answer any questions students have
      about any aspect of the course, and the upcoming class test.
    * Lab: the lab can be found [here](a_labs.html)
    * Surgery: go over the lab, answer any remaining questions on
      course material.
* Friday class test in FJ SW PW


Things to discuss:

* Alternative arrangements for class test
* Week 11: there is one scheduled session on Tues; normally no-one
  comes to it, but I am happy to deliver a session then; please post
  on Piazza if you want a session and what things you want to go over;
  if there is no demand, the session will be cancelled
* **How to calculate your mark for the module** (and in general, how to
  calculate your marks for any weighted assessment!)
