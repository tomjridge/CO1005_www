## Notes on class test 1


* Mock is the test from last year
* NOTE some of these questions (eg 4, 10) you can do, but really they
  are based on material we haven't covered yet (sorting)


## Notes on class test 3


* NOTE that qu 6 looks like a misprint.
* NOTE also that some of the questions in these tests are on material we haven't covered this year.
