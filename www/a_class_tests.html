## Notes on class test 1


* Mock is the test from last year
* NOTE some of these questions (eg 4, 10) you can do, but really they
  are based on material we haven't covered yet (sorting)


## Notes on class test 3

* I will send out a mock covering what would have been in test 2, as well as a mock covering test 3.
