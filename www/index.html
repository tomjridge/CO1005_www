## About this website

This website has 3 main pages. This is the first page. The second page
contains the weekly material. The third page contains the labs. Of course, there are further pages linked to from these pages, but essentially these are the ones you need to read fully.

## Announcements and module dashboard

Any timetable changes will be recorded here, and usually also emailed to all
students.

* 2018-03-28 **Changes to the module arising from the strike action** 
    * Class test 2 was cancelled. See below for how this affected the module grade calculation.
    * We didn't cover at all: exception handling; testing and
      debugging; JUnit; classpath; jar command; IDEs; eclipse
      debugging features
    * We covered in less detail than normally: abstract classes (these
      were included in the tutorial on interfaces, but I didn't talk
      about abstract classes in lectures)


* 2018-03-20 **How to calculate your module mark!** 
    * You need to work out the following: `(10% * lab mark) + (30% *
      class test 1 mark) + (60% * class test 3 mark)`
    * For example, if you scored 3/5 for labs, 8/12 for class test 1,
      and 7/12 for class test 3, you need to calculate: `(10% * 3/5) +
      (30% * 8/12) + (60% * 7/12)`
    * In order to calculate this, you also need to know that
      percentages are just numbers. For example 10% is 10/100, 20% is
      20/100 etc
    * So the above calculation becomes: `(10/100 * 3/5) + (30/100 * 8/12) + (60/100 * 7/12)`
    * You can do this easily by hand, or use a calculator. You should
      end up with a number between 0 and 1, which is your overall
      percentage. For example 0.61 is 61/100, which is 61%.

* <i class="material-icons">warning</i> 2018-03-09 there seems to be some confusion about assessment patterns given the impact of the strike. There are threads on Piazza. To summarize:
    * Class test 2 was cancelled due to strike (and subsequent bad
      weather). **The RELATIVE WEIGHTS of class test 1 and 3 have not
      changed.** The date of class test 3 has not changed. The
      duration of class test 3 has not changed. Class test 3 will be
      mostly on the material since the last test. You will not be
      tested on material we haven't covered.
    * Following on from the last point, in general, nothing has
      changed unless I explicitly communicate this via email,
      lectures, module webpages, Piazza etc. 
    * In case of confusion, you can always ask questions on Piazza, or
      email me directly.
    * Some of the labs on strike days have been cancelled (see the lab
      page for details).
    

* The study guide is
[here](../study_guide/study_guide.pdf).
* <i class="material-icons">warning</i> 2018-02-20 strikes are likely on Thu and Fri of this week
* <i class="material-icons">warning</i> 2018-01-16 there will be no sessions on Fri 26th Jan - the convenor is in London on University business
* 2018-01-15 new webpage
<!--
 * Make sure you understand the [prerequisites](additional.html#_prerequisites) for this module.
 * Please consult the [Timetable](timetable.html) and the
   [Weekly material](weeks.html).
   -->
* **Panopto recordings** of sessions should be available
  via blackboard (module CO1005). Please let me know if this doesn't
  seem to work. Otherwise, we do not use Blackboard.


## Feedback

- Please post all queries to the module site on Piazza: 
  https://piazza.com/university_of_leicester/spring2018/co1005
  (the access code, which is case sensitive, is "co1005" )
- Teaching assistants have been advised to give even more feedback
  in labs!
- We have introduced the "Feedback machine" to give further
  automated feedback during labs.
- Piazza has been introduced to coordinate and focus student
  queries.
- If you are unsure why your code is not correct, post (anonymously
  if you like) something to Piazza and we will give feedback there
  or in the surgery. Similarly, if you are in the surgery and don't
  understand something, please ask!
- We will stress to students that the following are the main forms
  of feedback in this module: **feedback in surgeries** (lab solutions,
  worked examples, student submissions examined); class test **marked
  scripts**; class test **model answers** and **in-class explanations** with
  **question and answer** session; **in-lab feedback from TAs** and convenor
  and also automated **feedback from the Feedback machine**; feedback on
  **Piazza**
- The convenor will try very hard to encourage questions during the
  lectures, to give feedback on what students find difficult.

Essentially, we want to **ensure** that, if there is anything you
**don't understand**, you get some form of **feedback** to help you.
We believe that there are ample opportunities to get feedback. If you
feel this is not true, we want to hear about it as soon as possible.
