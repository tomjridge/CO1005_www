## About this website

This website has 2 main pages. This is the first page. The second page
contains the weekly material. Of course, there are further pages linked to from these pages, but essentially these two are the ones you need to read fully.

## Feedback

- Please post all queries to the module site on Piazza: 
  https://piazza.com/university_of_leicester/spring2018/co1005
  (the access code, which is case sensitive, is "co1005" )
- Teaching assistants have been advised to give even more feedback
  in labs!
- We have introduced the "Feedback machine" to give further
  automated feedback during labs.
- Piazza has been introduced to coordinate and focus student
  queries.
- If you are unsure why your code is not correct, post (anonymously
  if you like) something to Piazza and we will give feedback there
  or in the surgery. Similarly, if you are in the surgery and don't
  understand something, please ask!
- We will stress to students that the following are the main forms
  of feedback in this module: **feedback in surgeries** (lab solutions,
  worked examples, student submissions examined); class test **marked
  scripts**; class test **model answers** and **in-class explanations** with
  **question and answer** session; **in-lab feedback from TAs** and convenor
  and also automated **feedback from the Feedback machine**; feedback on
  **Piazza**
- The convenor will try very hard to encourage questions during the
  lectures, to give feedback on what students find difficult.

Essentially, we want to **ensure** that, if there is anything you
**don't understand**, you get some form of **feedback** to help you.
We believe that there are ample opportunities to get feedback. If you
feel this is not true, we want to hear about it as soon as possible.
