# IDE and editor: Dr Java 

There are many IDEs and text editors around. I have asked for Dr Java to
be installed. You should be able to run it by typing `drjava` on the
console. This allows you to edit, save, compile, etc. It also allows you
to interactively investigate code through the REPL (interactive Java
console).

The Dr Java homepage is <http://www.drjava.org/>
