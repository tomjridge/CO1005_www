# Prerequisites

What do you need to take this course? Essentially the requirements are
very little.


* You need to be comfortable using a computer; particularly you need
  to understand the concepts of **files** and **directories**.
* You also need to have a basic familiarity with the Linux **command
  line** (sometimes called the "shell" or "bash"), particularly the
  commands `cd, ls, mkdir, pwd, rm, touch, java, javac` and the syntax
  `.` and `..` for current and parent directory.
 * Information about the `java` and `javac` commands can be found
   in the additional material for week 1. A video is
   [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kgVq65NRKQ). Please also
   see the week 1 additional material (particularly the Oracle
   getting started tutorials).
 * A video discussing the basics is
   [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDINUSK7rXE) (for the
   Mac, but Linux is essentially the same)
 * Another is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x73WTEltyHU)
   (you won’t be able to use `sudo`)
 * A more detailed set of videos is by someone called Steven
   Gordon, starting
   [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGoJsAEpsM).
 * And there are many many more. Find one that works for you. There
   are also books of course, many available in the library.
   <http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596009656.do> is probably
   OK (I haven’t read it myself).
* You need to be able to use a text editor to create `.java` source
  files, and save them in different directories.
* You need to be able to compile the `.java` files on the command line
  using `javac`.
* You need to be able to run the resulting `.class` files using `java`
* You need to have a working knowledge of basic Java syntax, such as
  is taught in CO1003.


From past experience, about 50% of the students will not have these
prerequisites. If you are one of these students, you need to get these
skills as soon as possible.


<i class="material-icons">warning</i> WARNING: In the labs this week I
will do random checks on individual students (so, you need to attend
the labs and be prepared to show me you can do
the above).
