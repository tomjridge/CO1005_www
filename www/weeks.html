### Slides, summaries and code

* [Prerequisites](a_prereqs.html): What you need to
  know before attending the course.
* [Introduction slides](../slides/intro.pdf): Introduction to
  the module.
* [Strings slides](../slides/strings.pdf): String programming
  (datastructures): strings; 4 or 5 essential string functions; how to
  understand while loops; the basic algorithm - walking through a
  string using a while loop; some simple functions on strings.
* The raw .java file which you can download, compile and run:
  [../java/string/String\_examples.java](../java/string/String_examples.java)
* Youtube videos "Java, strings, …​"
  [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxKUsnr0vDOSDOuI67WqPbjCyI2aNwLHc).
* Understand Java code by stepping through it using pythontutor (bad
  name): <http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit> (you have
  to choose Java as the language!)


### Other

* Labs, see [here](a_labs.html)
* Additional material, see [here](a_week1.html)

[here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxKUsnr0vDOSDOuI67WqPbjCyI2aNwLHc).

  (datastructures): lists; 4 or 5 essential list functions; string
  functions modified to work with lists.
* The raw .java file which you can download, compile and run:

### Other

* Lab, see [here](a_labs.html) 
* Remember the youtube videos, additional resources, etc.
* Mock class tests, answers etc [here](a_class_tests.html)
* Some stack/queue questions (see particularly question 6) http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr01/cs126/exercises/adt.html
* GeeksforGeeks http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ (look for questions on stacks and queues); this is a good site for general interview questions

* Tue: sets and maps (see last week); Thu: no lecture, instead we watched the inheritance video on youtube. Fri: test

### Other

* The class test will be on all the material up to end of week 3 (so,

* Optional slides: [Generic insertion sort](../slides/generic_insertion_sort.pdf)
* Code: [String insertion sort](../java/sorting/String_insertion_sort.java); [mergesort.zip](../java/sorting/mergesort.zip)


### Other

* Things to discuss: 
    * new lab page
    * lab 4 solutions - we will go through this in the surgery on Thu
