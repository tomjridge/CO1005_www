## Week 1


### Slides, summaries and code

* [Prerequisites](a_prereqs.html): What you need to
  know before attending the course.
* [Introduction slides](../slides/intro.pdf): Introduction to
  the module.
* [Strings slides](../slides/strings.pdf): String programming
  (datastructures): strings; 4 or 5 essential string functions; how to
  understand while loops; the basic algorithm - walking through a
  string using a while loop; some simple functions on strings.
* The raw .java file which you can download, compile and run:
  [../java/string/String\_examples.java](../java/string/String_examples.java)
* Youtube videos "Java, strings, …​"
  [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxKUsnr0vDOSDOuI67WqPbjCyI2aNwLHc).
* Understand Java code by stepping through it using pythontutor (bad
  name): <http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit> (you have
  to choose Java as the language!)


### Other

* Labs, see [here](a_labs.html)
* Additional material, see [here](a_week1.html)
* Screencasts: I have put quite a few screencasts and tutorials on youtube
[here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxKUsnr0vDOSDOuI67WqPbjCyI2aNwLHc).



<hr/>



## Week 2


### Slides, summaries and code

* String programming, slides as last week
* Surgery, probably taken by Tom. Topics that may be covered: last week's lab, this week's lab.

### Other

* Lab, see [here](a_labs.html)
* Remember the youtube videos, additional resources, etc.



<hr/>





## Week 3


### Slides, summaries and code

* String programming, slides as first week
* Surgery, probably taken by a TA. Topics that may be covered: last week's lab, this week's lab.
* [List slides](../slides/lists.pdf): List programming
  (datastructures): lists; 4 or 5 essential list functions; string
  functions modified to work with lists.
* The raw .java file which you can download, compile and run:
  [List_examples.java](../java/list/List_examples.java)
* [Stacks, queues, sets and maps](../slides/stacks_queues_sets_maps.pdf)

### Other

* Lab, see [here](a_labs.html) 
* Remember the youtube videos, additional resources, etc.
* Mock class test 1 (the actual class test from last year) [here](../class_tests/old_class_test_1.pdf)  NOTE some of these questions (eg 4, 10) you can do, but really they are based on material we haven't covered yet (sorting)
* Mock class test answers [here](../class_tests/old_ct1_answers.pdf)
* Some stack/queue questions (see particularly question 6) http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr01/cs126/exercises/adt.html
* GeeksforGeeks http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ (look for questions on stacks and queues); this is a good site for general interview questions


<hr/>



## Week 4


### Slides, summaries and code

* Tue: sets and maps (see last week); Thu: no lecture, instead we watched the inheritance video on youtube. Fri: test

### Other

* The class test will be on all the material up to end of week 3 (so,
  it may cover stacks and queues, but it will not cover sets and
  maps).
* Lab, see [here](a_labs.html) 

<hr/>


## Week 5


### Slides, summaries and code

* Slides: [Generic types](../slides/generic_types.pdf); [Introduction to sorting](../slides/sorting_intro.pdf); [More on recursion](../slides/more_on_recursion.pdf); [Mergesort](../slides/mergesort.pdf); [Java interfaces](../slides/interfaces.pdf)
* Optional slides: [Generic insertion sort](../slides/generic_insertion_sort.pdf)
* Code: [String insertion sort](../java/sorting/String_insertion_sort.java); [mergesort.zip](../java/sorting/mergesort.zip)


### Other

* Things to discuss: 
    * new lab page
    * lab 4 solutions - we will go through this in the surgery on Thu
    * Thu 09:00am lecture is replaced by a video (probably on interfaces)
    * Thu lab is on inheritance and interfaces.
    
* Lab, see [here](a_labs.html)
