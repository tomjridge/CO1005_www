    <h1>Screencasts</h1>

    <p>These screencasts can be viewed on Linux using either the
    dragon video player (if available) or the VLC video player (VLC is
    preferred). They can be viewed on Windows using the VLC video
    player. Do not try to view the videos in the web browser, download
    them first. If you are running out of disk space, download them to
    the directory /tmp. You need to plug headphones into the computer
    (the computers do not have their own speakers). On some systems
    the sound slightly lags the video. Not all computers in CW3 have
    sound apparently (Gilbert is looking into this). The sound is
    quite quiet- turn the volume on the media player up, and turn the
    system volume up. To turn the system volume up: Applications -&gt;
    Sound and Video -&gt; Mixer; then &quot;select controls&quot;, check at least
    &quot;master&quot; and &quot;pcm&quot;, then turn the volume up.
